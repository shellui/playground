# ShellUI Playground

Welcome to the **ShellUI Playground**! 🚀

This repository is designed to help you explore and test **ShellUI**, a powerful microfrontend orchestration framework.

## What's Inside?

*   **Microfrontend Pages**: Simple HTML examples (`src/pages/`) demonstrating isolated page content.
*   **Shell Configuration**: Check out `src/shellui.json` to see how navigation and routes are defined.

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Explore the `src/pages` to see how microfrontends are structured.
3.  Modify `src/shellui.json` to test different layouts and routing configurations.

Dive in, break things, and see how ShellUI can streamline your frontend architecture!
